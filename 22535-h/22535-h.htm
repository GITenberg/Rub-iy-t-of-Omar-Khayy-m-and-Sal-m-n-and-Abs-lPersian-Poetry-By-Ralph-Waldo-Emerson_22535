A planet equal to the sun;<br />

<h2>LIFE OF EDWARD FITZGERALD.</h2>

<p class='initial'><span class='smcap'>Edward FitzGerald</span> was born in the year 1809, at Bredfield House, near
Woodbridge, Suffolk, being the third son of John Purcell, who,
subsequently to his marriage with a Miss FitzGerald, assumed the name
and arms proper to his wife&rsquo;s family.</p>

<p>St. Germain and Paris were in turn the home of his earlier years, but in
1821, he was sent to the Grammar School at Bury St. Edmunds. During his
stay in that ancient foundation he was the fellow pupil of James
Spedding and J. M. Kemble. From there he went in 1826 to Trinity
College, Cambridge, where he made the acquaintance of W. M. Thackeray
and others of only less note. His school and college friendships were
destined to prove lasting, as were, also, all those he was yet to form.</p>

<p>One of FitzGerald&rsquo;s chief characteristics was what might almost be
called a genius for friendship. <span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_2' id='Page_2'>[Pg 2]</a></span> He did not, indeed, wear his heart upon
his sleeve, but ties once formed were never unloosed by any failure in
charitable and tender affection on his part. Never, throughout a lengthy
life, did irritability and erratic petulance (displayed &rsquo;tis true, at
times by the translator of &ldquo;that large infidel&rdquo;), darken the eyes of
those he honoured with his friendship to the simple and whole-hearted
genuineness of the man.</p>

<p>From Oxford, FitzGerald retired to the &lsquo;suburb grange&rsquo; at Woodbridge,
referred to by Tennyson. Here, narrowing his bodily wants to within the
limits of a Pythagorean fare, he led a life of a truly simple type
surrounded by books and roses, and, as ever, by a few firm friends.
Annual visits to London in the months of Spring kept alive the alliances
of earlier days, and secured for him yet other intimates, notably the
Tennyson brothers.</p>

<p>Amongst the languages, Spanish seems to have been his earlier love. His
translation of Calderon, due to obedience to the guiding impulse of
Professor Cowell, showed him to the world as a master of the rarest of
arts, that of conveying to an English audience the lights and shades of
a poem first fashioned in a foreign tongue.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_3' id='Page_3'>[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p>At the bidding of the same mentor, he, later, turned his attention to
Persian, the first fruits of his toil being an anonymous version, in
Miltonic verse, of the &lsquo;Sal&aacute;m&aacute;n and Abs&aacute;l&rsquo; of J&aacute;mi. Soon after, the
treasure-house of the Bodleian library yielded up to him the pearl of
his literary endeavour, the verses of &ldquo;Omar Khayy&aacute;m,&rdquo; a pearl whose
dazzling charm previously had been revealed to but few, and that through
the medium of a version published in Paris by Monsieur Nicolas.</p>

<p>FitzGerald&rsquo;s hasty and ill-advised union with Lucy, daughter of Bernard
Barton, the Quaker poet and friend of Lamb, was but short-lived, and
demands no comment. They agreed to part.</p>

<p>In later life, most summers found the poet on board his yacht &ldquo;The
Scandal&rdquo; (so-called as being the staple product of the neighbourhood) in
company with &lsquo;Posh&rsquo; as he dubbed Fletcher, the fisherman of Aldeburgh,
whose correspondence with FitzGerald has lately been given to the world.</p>

<p>To the end he loved the sea, his books, his roses and his friends, and
that end came to him, when on a visit with his friend Crabbe, with all
the kindliness of sudden death, on the 14th June, 1883.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_4' id='Page_4'>[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides the works already mentioned, FitzGerald was the author of
&ldquo;Euphranor&rdquo; [1851], a Platonic Dialogue on Youth; &ldquo;Polonius&rdquo;: a
Collection of Wise Saws and Modern Instances [1852]; and translations of
the &ldquo;Agamemnon&rdquo; of &AElig;schylus [1865]; and the &ldquo;&#338;dipus Tyrannus&rdquo; and
&ldquo;&#338;dipus Coloneus&rdquo; of Sophocles. Of these translations the &ldquo;Agamemnon&rdquo;
probably ranks next to the Rub&aacute;iy&aacute;t in merit. To the six dramas of
Calderon, issued in 1853, there were added two more in 1865. Of these
plays, &ldquo;Vida es Sueno&rdquo; and &ldquo;El Magico Prodigioso&rdquo; possess especial
merit.</p>

<p>His &ldquo;Rub&aacute;iy&aacute;t of Omar Khayy&aacute;m&rdquo; was first issued anonymously on January
15th, 1859, but it caused no great stir, and, half-forgotten, was
reintroduced to the notice of the literary world in the following year
by Rossetti, and, in this connection, it is curious to note to what a
large extent Rossetti played the part of a literary Lucina. FitzGerald,
Blake and Wells are all indebted to him for timely aid in the
reanimation of offspring, that seemed doomed to survive but for a short
time the pangs that gave them birth. Mr. Swinburne and Lord Houghton
were also impressed by its merits, and its fame slowly spread. Eight
years elapsed, however, before the publication of the second edition.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_5' id='Page_5'>[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>After the passage of a quarter-of-a-century a considerable stimulus was
given to the popularity of the &ldquo;Rub&aacute;iy&aacute;t&rdquo; by the fact that
Tennyson&mdash;appropriately enough in view of FitzGerald&rsquo;s translation of
Sophocles&rsquo; &ldquo;&#338;dipus&rdquo;&mdash;prefaced his &ldquo;Tiresias, and other Poems,&rdquo; with
some charmingly reminiscent lines written to &ldquo;Old Fitz&rdquo; on his last
birthday. &ldquo;This,&rdquo; says Mr. Edmund Gosse, &ldquo;was but the signal for that
universal appreciation of &lsquo;Omar Khayy&aacute;m&rsquo; in his English dress, which has
been one of the curious literary phenomena of recent years. The melody
of FitzGerald&rsquo;s verse is so exquisite, the thoughts he rearranges and
strings together are so profound, and the general atmosphere of poetry
in which he steeps his version is so pure, that no surprise need be
expressed at the universal favour which the poem has met with among
critical readers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neither the &ldquo;Rub&aacute;iy&aacute;t&rdquo; nor his other works are mere translations. They
are better, perhaps, described as consisting of &ldquo;largely new work based
on the nominal originals.&rdquo; In the &ldquo;Omar,&rdquo; admittedly the highest in
quality of his works, he undoubtedly took considerable liberties with
his author, and introduced lines, or even entire quatrains, which,
however they may breathe the spirit of the original, have no material
counterpart therein.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_6' id='Page_6'>[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>In illustration of FitzGerald&rsquo;s capacity for conveying the spirit rather
than the very words of the original, comparison of the Ousely MS. of
1460 <span class='smcap'>A.D.</span>, in the Bodleian Library at Oxford, with the &ldquo;Rub&aacute;iy&aacute;t&rdquo; as we
know it, is of great interest.</p>

<p>The MS. runs thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class='poem2'>For a while, when young, we frequented a teacher;<br />
For a while we were contented with our proficiency;<br />
Behold the foundation of the discourse!&mdash;what happened to us?<br />
We came in like Water, and we depart like Wind.</p>

<p>In FitzGerald&rsquo;s version the verses appear thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class='poem2'>Myself when young did eagerly frequent<br />
Doctor and Saint and heard great Argument<br />
<span class='poemi1'>But it and about: but evermore</span><br />
Came out by the same Door as in I went.</p>

<p class='poem2'>With them the Seed of Wisdom did I sow<br />
And with my own hand labour&rsquo;d it to grow:<br />
<span class='poemi1'>And this was all the Harvest that I reap&rsquo;d&mdash;</span><br />
&ldquo;I came like Water, and like Wind I go.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_7' id='Page_7'>[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>Similar examples may be found elsewhere, thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class='poem2'>From the Beginning was written what shall be<br />
Unhaltingly the Pen writes, and is heedless of good and bad;<br />
On the First Day He appointed everything that must be,<br />
Our grief and our efforts are vain,</p>

<p>develops into:&mdash;</p>

<p class='poem2'>The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ,<br />
Moves on: nor all thy Piety nor Wit<br />
<span class='poemi1'>Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line,</span><br />
Nor all thy Tears wash out a Word of it.</p>

<p>The general tendency to amplification is shown again in the translation
of the two lines:&mdash;</p>

<p class='poem2'>Forsake not the book, the lover&rsquo;s lips and the green bank of the field,<br />
Ere that the earth enfold thee in its bosom.</p>

<p>into the oft-quoted verses:&mdash;</p>

<p class='poem2'>With me along some Strip of Herbage strown<br />
That just divides the desert from the sown,<br />
<span class='poemi1'>Where the name of Slave and Sult&aacute;n scarce is known,</span><br />
And pity Sult&aacute;n M&aacute;hm&uacute;d on his Throne.</p>

<p class='poem2'>Here with a Loaf of Bread beneath the Bough,<br />
A Flask of Wine, a Book of Verse&mdash;and Thou<br />
<span class='poemi1'>Beside me singing in the Wilderness&mdash;</span><br />
And Wilderness is Paradise enow!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_8' id='Page_8'>[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>And in the lines of Omar:&mdash;</p>

<p class='poem2'>In a thousand places on the road I walk, thou placest snares.<br />
Thou sayest: &ldquo;I will catch thee if thou steppeth into them,&rdquo;<br />
In no smallest thing is the world independent of thee,<br />
<i>Thou</i> orderest all things&mdash;and callest <i>me</i> rebellious!</p>

<p>majestically shaping into FitzGerald&rsquo;s rendering:&mdash;</p>

<p class='poem2'>Oh, Thou, who didst with Pitfall and with Gin<br />
Beset the Road I was to wander in,<br />
<span class='poemi1'>Thou wilt not with Predestination round</span><br />
Enmesh me, and impute my Fall to Sin?</p>

<p class='poem2'>Oh, Thou, who Man of baser Earth didst make<br />
And who with Eden didst devise the Snake;<br />
<span class='poemi1'>For all the Sin wherewith the Face of Man</span><br />
Is blacken&rsquo;d, Man&rsquo;s Forgiveness give&mdash;and take!</p>

<p>To what school did FitzGerald belong? Who were his literary progenitors?
Lucretius, Horace and Donne, at any rate, had a considerable share in
moulding his thought and fashioning the form of his verse. The unrhymed
line, so often but by no means uniformly resounding with a suspended
clangour that is not caught up by the following stanza is distinctly
reminiscent of the Alcaics of Horace.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_9' id='Page_9'>[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>Epicurean, in the ordinary sense of the term, he certainly is, but it is
of the earlier type. Cyrenaic would be a juster epithet, the &ldquo;<i>carpe
diem</i>&rdquo; doctrine of the poem is too gross and sensual to have commended
itself to the real Epicurus. Intense fatalism, side by side with
complete agnosticism, this is the keynote of the poem. Theoretically
incompatible, these two &ldquo;isms&rdquo; are in practice inevitable companions.</p>

<p>The theory of reincarnation and that alone, can furnish a full
explanation of FitzGerald&rsquo;s splendid success as a translator.</p>

<p>Omar was FitzGerald and FitzGerald was Omar. Both threw away their
shields and retired to their tent, not indeed to sulk, but to seek in
meditative aloofness, the calm and content that is the proper reward of
those alone who persevere to the end. Retirement brought them all it
could bring, a yet deeper sense of the vanity of things and their
unknowableness. Herein for the mass of mankind lies the charm of the

<h2>PREFACE<br />
TO<br />
Rub&aacute;iy&aacute;t of Omar Khayy&aacute;m.</h2>

<p class='initial'><span class='smcap'>Omar Khayy&aacute;m</span>, or Chiam, was born about the middle of the 11th Century,
at Naish&aacute;p&uacute;r, Khorass&aacute;n, and he died in that town about the year 1123.</p>

<p>Little is known as to the details of his life, and such facts as are
available have been drawn principally from the <i>Was&iacute;yat</i> or <i>Testament</i>
of Mizam al Mulk (<i>Regulation of the Realm</i>), who was a fellow-pupil of
Omar at the school of the celebrated Im&aacute;m Mowafek or Mowaffak. Reference
to this is made in Mirkhond&rsquo;s <i>History of the Assassins</i>, from which the
following extract<a name='FNanchor_A_1' id='FNanchor_A_1'></a><a href='#Footnote_A_1' class='fnanchor'>[A]</a> is taken.</p>

<p class='blockquot'>&ldquo;&lsquo;One of the greatest of the wise men of Khorass&aacute;n was the
Im&aacute;n Mowaffak of Naish&aacute;p&uacute;r, a man highly honoured and
reverenced,&mdash;may God rejoice his soul; his illustrious years
exceeded eighty-five, and it was the universal belief that
every boy who read the Koran, or studied the traditions in his
presence, would assuredly attain to honour and happiness. <span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_14' id='Page_14'>[Pg 14]</a></span> For
this cause did my father send me from T&uacute;s to Naish&aacute;p&uacute;r with
Abd-u-samad, the doctor of law, that I might employ myself in
study and learning under the guidance of that illustrious
teacher. Towards me he ever turned an eye of favour and
kindness, and as his pupil I felt for him extreme affection
and devotion, so that I passed four years in his service. When
I first came there, I found two other pupils of mine own age
newly arrived, Hakim Omar Khayy&aacute;m and the ill-fated Ben
Sabb&aacute;h. Both were endowed with sharpness of wit and the
highest natural powers; and we three formed a close friendship
together. When the Im&aacute;m rose from his lectures, they used to
join me, and we repeated to each other the lessons we had
heard. Now Omar was a native of Naish&aacute;p&uacute;r, while Hasan Ben
Sabb&aacute;h&rsquo;s father was one Ali, a man of austere life and
practice, but heretical in his creed and doctrine. One day
Hasan said to me and to Khayy&aacute;m, &ldquo;It is a universal belief
that the pupils of the Im&aacute;m Mowaffak will attain to fortune. <span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_15' id='Page_15'>[Pg 15]</a></span>
Now, if we <i>all</i> do not attain thereto, without doubt one of
us will; what then shall be our mutual pledge and bond?&rdquo; We
answered, &ldquo;Be it what you please.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;let us
make a vow, that to whomsoever this fortune falls, he shall
share it equally with the rest, and reserve no pre-eminence
for himself.&rdquo; &ldquo;Be it so,&rdquo; we both replied; and on those terms
we mutually pledged our words. Years rolled on, and I went
from Khorass&aacute;n to Transoxiana, and wandered to Ghazni and
Cabul; and when I returned, I was invested with office, and
rose to be administrator of affairs during the Sultanate of
Sultan Alp Arsl&aacute;n.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He goes on to state, that years passed by, and both his old
school-friends found him out, and came and claimed a share in
his good fortune according to the school-day vow. The Vizier
was generous and kept his word. Hasan demanded a place in the
government, which the Sultan granted at the Vizier&rsquo;s request;
but, discontented with a gradual rise, he plunged into the
maze of intrigue of an Oriental Court, and, failing in a base
attempt to supplant his benefactor, he was disgraced and fell.
After many mishaps and wanderings, Hasan became the head of
the Persian sect of the <i>Isma&iacute;lians</i>,&mdash;a party of fanatics who
had long murmured in obscurity, but rose to an evil eminence
under the guidance of his strong and evil will. <span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_16' id='Page_16'>[Pg 16]</a></span> In A.D. 1090
he seized the castle of Alam&uacute;t, in the province of R&uacute;dbar,
which lies in the mountainous tract, south of the Caspian sea;
and it was from this mountain home he obtained that evil
celebrity among the Crusaders, as the OLD MAN OF THE
MOUNTAINS, and spread terror through the Mohammedan world; and
it is yet disputed whether the word <i>Assassin</i>, which they
have left in the language of modern Europe as their dark
memorial, is derived from the <i>hashish</i>, or opiate of
hemp-leaves (the Indian <i>bhang</i>), with which they maddened
themselves to the sullen pitch of oriental desperation, or
from the name of the founder of the dynasty, whom we have seen
in his quiet collegiate days, at Naish&aacute;p&uacute;r. One of the
countless victims of the Assassin&rsquo;s dagger was Niz&aacute;m al Mulk
himself, the old school-boy friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Omar Khayy&aacute;m also came to the Vizier to claim his share; but
not to ask for title or office. &lsquo;The greatest boon you can
confer on me,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;is to let me live in a corner under
the shadow of your fortune, to spread wide the advantages of
Science, and pray for your long life and prosperity.&rsquo; The
Vizier tells us, that when he found Omar was really sincere
in his refusal, he pressed him no further, but granted him a
yearly pension of 1,200 <i>mithk&aacute;ls</i> of gold from the treasury
of Naish&aacute;p&uacute;r. <span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_17' id='Page_17'>[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;At Naish&aacute;p&uacute;r thus lived and died Omar Khayy&aacute;m, &lsquo;busied,&rsquo; adds
the Vizier, &lsquo;in winning knowledge of every kind, and
especially in Astronomy, wherein he attained to a very high
pre-eminence. Under the Sultanate of Malik Shah, he came to
Merv, and obtained great praise for his proficiency in
science, and the Sultan showered favours upon him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When Malik Shah determined to reform the calendar, Omar was
one of the eight learned men employed to do it; the result was
the <i>Jal&aacute;li</i> era (so-called from <i>Jalal-ul-Din</i>, one of the
king&rsquo;s names)&mdash;&lsquo;a computation of time,&rsquo; says Gibbon, &lsquo;which
surpasses the Julian, and approaches the accuracy of the
Gregorian style.&rsquo; He is also the author of some astronomical
tables, entitled &lsquo;Z&iacute;ji-Maliksh&aacute;h&iacute;,&rsquo; and the French have lately
republished and translated an Arabic treatise of his on
Algebra.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These severe Studies, and his verses, which, though happily
fewer than any Persian Poet&rsquo;s, and, though perhaps fugitively
composed, the Result of no fugitive Emotion or Thought, are
probably the Work and Event of his Life, leaving little else
to record. Perhaps he liked a little Farming too, so often as
he speaks of the &lsquo;Edge of the Tilth&rsquo; on which he loved to rest
with his Diw&aacute;n of Verse, his Loaf&mdash;and his Wine. <span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_18' id='Page_18'>[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;His Takhallus or poetical name (Khayy&aacute;m) signifies a
Tent-maker, and he is said to have at one time exercised that
trade, perhaps before Niz&aacute;m al Mulk&rsquo;s generosity raised him to
independence. Many Persian poets similarly derive their names
from their occupations: thus we have Att&aacute;r &lsquo;a druggist,&rsquo; Ass&aacute;r
&lsquo;an oil presser,&rsquo; etc. Omar himself alludes to his name in the
following whimsical lines:&mdash;</p>

<p class='poem2'>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Khayy&aacute;m, who stitched the tents of science,<br />
Has fallen in grief&rsquo;s furnace and been suddenly burned;<br />
The shears of Fate have cut the tent ropes of his life,<br />
And the broker of Hope has sold him for nothing!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have only one more anecdote to give of his Life, and that
relates to the close; related in the anonymous preface which
is sometimes prefixed to his poems; it has been printed in the
Persian in the appendix to Hyde&rsquo;s <i>Veterum Persarum Religio</i>,
p. 449; and D&rsquo;Herbelot alludes to it in his Biblioth&eacute;que,
under <i>Khiam</i><a name='FNanchor_B_2' id='FNanchor_B_2'></a><a href='#Footnote_B_2' class='fnanchor'>[B]</a>:&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_19' id='Page_19'>[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is written in the chronicles of the ancients that this
King of the Wise, Omar Khayy&aacute;m, died at Naish&aacute;p&uacute;r in the year
of the Hegira, 517 (A.D. 1123); in science he was
unrivalled,&mdash;the very paragon of his age. Khw&aacute;jah Niz&aacute;mi of
Samarcand, who was one of his pupils, relates the following
story: &ldquo;I often used to hold conversation with my teacher,
Omar Khayy&aacute;m, in a garden; and one day he said to me, &lsquo;My tomb
shall be in a spot where the north wind may scatter roses over
it.&rsquo; I wondered at the words he spake, but I knew that his
were no idle words. Years after, when I chanced to revisit
Naish&aacute;p&uacute;r I went to his final resting place, and lo! it was
just outside a garden, and trees laden with fruit stretched
their boughs over the garden wall, and dropped their flowers
upon his tomb, so as the stone was hidden under them.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_20' id='Page_20'>[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>Much discussion has arisen in regard to the meaning of Omar&rsquo;s poetry.
Some writers have insisted on a mystical interpretation and M. Nicholas
goes so far as to state his opinion that Omar devoted himself &ldquo;avec
passion &agrave; l&rsquo;&eacute;tude de la philosphie des Soufis.&rdquo; On the other hand Von
Hammer, the author of a <i>History of the Assassins</i>, refers to Omar as a
Freethinker and a great opponent of Sufism.</p>

<p>Probably, in the absence of agreement amongst authorities, the soundest
view is that expressed by FitzGerald&rsquo;s editor,<a name='FNanchor_C_3' id='FNanchor_C_3'></a><a href='#Footnote_C_3' class='fnanchor'>[C]</a> that the real Omar
Khayy&aacute;m was a Philosopher, of scientific insight and ability far beyond
that of the Age and Country he lived in; of such moderate and worldly
Ambition as becomes a Philosopher, and such moderate wants as rarely
satisfy a Debauchee; that while the Wine Omar celebrates is simply the
Juice of the Grape, he bragged more than he drank of it, in very
defiance perhaps of that Spiritual Wine which left its Votaries sunk in
Hypocrisy or Disgust.</p>

And wearing a White Turban on his Head,<br />
Turn&rsquo;d his Rein tow&rsquo;rd me, and with smiling Lips<br />
Open&rsquo;d before my Eyes the Door of Peace.<br />
Then, riding up to me, dismounted; kiss&rsquo;d<br />
My Hand, and did me Courtesy; and I,<br />
How glad of his Protection, and the Grace<br />
He gave it with!&mdash;Who then of gracious Speech<br />
Many a Jewel utter&rsquo;d; but of these<br />

<p class='poem3'>One Night The Shah of Y&uacute;nan, as his wont,<br />

How great it was, and how about him sat<br />
The Robe of Honour of Prosperity;<br />

Unless a Son, who his Dominion<br />
And Glory might inherit after him,<br />
And then he turn&rsquo;d him to The Shah and said;<br />
&ldquo;Oh Thou, whose Wisdom is the Rule of Kings&mdash;<br />
(Glory to God who gave it!)&mdash;answer me;<br />
Is any Blessing better than a Son?<br />

Shall live beyond Himself; by whom his Eyes<br />
Shine living, and his Dust with Roses blows;<br /><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_55' id='Page_55'>[Pg 55]</a></span>

A Hand to stop thy Falling; in his Youth<br />
Thou shall be Young, and in his Strength be Strong;<br />
Sharp shall he be in Battle as a Sword,<br />
A Cloud of Arrows on the Enemy&rsquo;s Head;<br />
His Voice shall cheer his Friends to Plight,<br />
And turn the Foeman&rsquo;s Glory into Flight.&rdquo;<br />
Thus much of a Good Son, whose wholesome Growth<br />
Approves the Root he grew from; but for one<br />
Kneaded of Evil&mdash;Well, could one undo<br />
His Generation, and as early pull<br />
Him and his Vices from the String of Time.<br />
Like Noah&rsquo;s, puff&rsquo;d with Ignorance and Pride,<br />
Who felt the Stab of &ldquo;He is none of Thine!&rdquo;<br />
And perish&rsquo;d in the Deluge. And because<br />
All are not Good, be slow to pray for One<br />

Fresh Rose, and then a Grain of Musk lay there,<br />
The Bird of the Belov&eacute;d Heart to snare.<br />
Now with a Laugh would break the Ruby Seal<br />
That lockt up Pearl; or busied in the Room<br />
Would smite her Hand perhaps&mdash;on that pretence<br />

<h2>PERSIAN POETRY<br />
BY<br />
RALPH WALDO EMERSON</h2>

<p>To Baron Von Hammer-Purgstall, who died in Vienna in 1856, we owe our
best knowledge of the Persians. He has translated into German, besides
the &ldquo;Divan&rdquo; of Hafiz, specimens of two hundred poets, who wrote during a
period of five and a half centuries, from <span class='smcap'>A.D.</span> 1050 to 1600. The seven
masters of the Persian Parnassus&mdash;Firdousi, Enweri, Nisami,
Dschelaleddin, Saadi, Hafiz, and Dschami<a name='FNanchor_D_4' id='FNanchor_D_4'></a><a href='#Footnote_D_4' class='fnanchor'>[D]</a>&mdash;have ceased to be empty
names; and others, like Ferideddin Attar and Omar Chiam, promise to rise
in Western estimation. That for which mainly books exist is communicated
in these rich extracts. Many qualities go to make a good telescope,&mdash;as
the largeness of the field, facility of sweeping the meridian,
achromatic purity of lenses, and so forth,&mdash;but the one eminent value is
the space penetrating power; and there are many virtues in books,&mdash;but
the essential value is the adding of knowledge to our stock, by the
record of new facts, and, better, by the record of intuitions, which
distribute facts, and are the formulas which supersede all histories. <span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_104' id='Page_104'>[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>Oriental life and society, especially in the Southern nations, stand in
violent contrast with the multitudinous detail, the secular stability,
and the vast average of comfort of the Western nations. Life in the East
is fierce, short, hazardous, and in extremes. Its elements are few and
simple, not exhibiting the long range and undulation of European
existence, but rapidly reaching the best and the worst. The rich feed on
fruits and game,&mdash;the poor on a watermelon&rsquo;s peel. All or nothing is the
genius of Oriental life. Favour of the Sultan, or his displeasure, is a
question of Fate. A war is undertaken for an epigram or a distich, as in
Europe for a duchy. The prolific sun, and the sudden and rank plenty
which his heat engenders, make subsistence easy. On the other side, the
desert, the simoom, the mirage, the lion, and the plague endanger it,
and life hangs on the contingency of a skin of water more or less. The
very geography of old Persia showed these contrasts. &ldquo;My father&rsquo;s
empire,&rdquo; said Cyrus to Xenophon, &ldquo;is so large, that people perish with
cold, at one extremity, whilst they are suffocated with heat, at the
other.&rdquo; The temperament of the people agrees with this life in
extremes. <span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_105' id='Page_105'>[Pg 105]</a></span> Religion and poetry are all their civilization. The religion
teaches an inexorable Destiny. It distinguishes only two days in each
man&rsquo;s history&mdash;his birthday, called <i>the Day of the Lot</i>, and the Day of
Judgment. Courage and absolute submission to what is appointed him are
his virtues.</p>

<p>The favour of the climate making subsistence easy and encouraging an
outdoor life, allows to the Eastern nations a highly intellectual
organization,&mdash;leaving out of view, at present, the genius of the
Hindoos (more Oriental in every sense), whom no people have surpassed in
the grandeur of their ethical statement. The Persians and the Arabs,
with great leisure and few books, are exquisitely sensible to the
pleasures of poetry. Layard has given some details of the effect which
the <i>improvvisatori</i> produced on the children of the desert. &ldquo;When the
bard improvised an amatory ditty, the young chief&rsquo;s excitement was
almost beyond control. The other Bedouins were scarcely less moved by
these rude measures, which have the same kind of effect on the wild
tribes of the Persian mountains. Such verses, chanted by their
self-taught poets, or by the girls of their encampment, will drive
warriors to the combat, fearless of death, or prove an ample reward, on
their return from the dangers of the <i>ghazon</i>, or the fight. <span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_106' id='Page_106'>[Pg 106]</a></span> The
excitement they produce exceeds that of the grape. He who would
understand the influence of the Homeric ballads in the heroic ages
should witness the effect which similar compositions have upon the wild
nomads of the East.&rdquo; Elsewhere he adds, &ldquo;Poetry and flowers are the wine
and spirits of the Arab; a couplet is equal to a bottle, and a rose to a
dram, without the evil effect of either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Persian poetry rests on a mythology whose few legends are connected
with the Jewish history, and the anterior traditions of the Pentateuch.
The principal figure in the allusions of Eastern poetry is Solomon.
Solomon had three talismans; first, the signet-ring, by which he
commanded the spirits, on the stone of which was engraven the name of
God; second, the glass, in which he saw the secrets of his enemies, and
the causes of all things, figured; the third, the east-wind, which was
his horse. His counsellor was Simorg, king of birds, the all-wise fowl,
who had lived ever since the beginning of the world, and now lives alone
on the highest summit of Mount Kaf. No fowler has taken him, and none
now living has seen him. By him Solomon was taught the language of
birds, so that he heard secrets whenever he went into his gardens. <span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_107' id='Page_107'>[Pg 107]</a></span> When
Solomon travelled, the throne was placed on a carpet of green silk, of a
length and breadth sufficient for all his army to stand upon,&mdash;men
placing themselves on his right hand, and the spirits on his left. When
all were in order, the east-wind, at his command, took up the carpet and
transported it, with all that were upon it, whither he pleased,&mdash;the
army of birds at the same time flying overhead, and forming a canopy to
shade them from the sun. It is related that when the Queen of Sheba came
to visit Solomon, he had built, against her arrival, a palace, of which
the floor or pavement was of glass, laid over running water, in which
fish were swimming. The Queen of Sheba was deceived thereby, and raised
her robes, thinking she was to pass through the water. On the occasion
of Solomon&rsquo;s marriage, all the beasts, laden with presents, appeared
before his throne. Behind them all came the ant, with a blade of grass:
Solomon did not despise the gift of the ant. Asaph, the vizier, at a
certain time, lost the seal of Solomon, which one of the Dews, or evil
spirits, found, and, governing in the name of Solomon, deceived the
people.</p>

<p>Firdousi, the Persian Homer, has written in the <i>Shah Nameh</i> the annals
of the fabulous and heroic kings of the country: <span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_108' id='Page_108'>[Pg 108]</a></span> of Karum (the Persian
Cr&#339;sus), the immeasurably rich gold-maker, who, with all his
treasures, lies buried not far from the Pyramids, in the sea which bears
his name; of Jamschid, the binder of demons, whose reign lasted seven
hundred years; of Kai Kaus, in whose palace, built by demons on Alburz,
gold and silver and precious stones were used so lavishly, that in the
brilliancy produced by their combined effect, night and day appeared the
same; of Afrasiyab, strong as an elephant, whose shadow extended for
miles, whose heart was bounteous as the ocean, and his hands like the
clouds when rain falls to gladden the earth. The crocodile in the
rolling stream had no safety from Afrasiyab. Yet when he came to fight
against the generals of Kaus, he was but an insect in the grasp of
Rustem, who seized him by the girdle, and dragged him from his horse.
Rustem felt such anger at the arrogance of the King of Mazinderan, that
every hair on his body started up like a spear. The gripe of his hand
cracked the sinews of an enemy.</p>

<p>These legends,&mdash;with Chiser, the fountain of life, Tuba, the tree of
life,&mdash;the romances of the loves of Leila and Medschun, of Chosru and
Schirin, and those of the nightingale for the rose,&mdash;pearl-diving, and
the virtues of gems,&mdash;the cohol, the cosmetic by which pearls and
eyebrows are indelibly stained black,&mdash;the bladder in which musk is
brought,&mdash;the down of the lip, the mole on the cheek, the
eyelash,&mdash;lilies, roses, tulips and jasmines,&mdash;make the staple imagery
of Persian odes. <span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_109' id='Page_109'>[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>The Persians have epics and tales, but, for the most part, they affect
short poems and epigrams. Gnomic verses, rules of life conveyed in a
lively image, especially in an image addressed to the eye, and contained
in a single stanza, were always current in the East; and if the poem is
long, it is only a string of unconnected verses. They use an
inconsecutiveness quite alarming to Western logic, and the connection
between the stanzas of their longer odes is much like that between the
refrain of our old English ballads,</p>

<p class='poem2'>&ldquo;The sun shines fair on Carlisle wall,&rdquo;</p>

<p>or</p>

<p class='poem2'>&ldquo;The rain it raineth every day,&rdquo;</p>

<p>and the main story.</p>

<p>Take, as specimens of these gnomic verses, the following:&mdash;</p>

<p class='poem2'>&ldquo;The secret that should not be blown<br />
<span class='poemi1'>Not one of thy nation must know;</span><br />
You may padlock the gate of a town,<br />
<span class='poemi1'>But never the mouth of a foe.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_110' id='Page_110'>[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>Or this of Omar Chiam:&mdash;</p>

<p class='poem2'>&ldquo;On earth&rsquo;s wide thoroughfares below<br />
Two only men contented go:<br />
Who knows what&rsquo;s right and what&rsquo;s forbid,<br />
And he from whom is knowledge hid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here is a poem on a melon, by Adsched of Meru:&mdash;</p>

<p class='poem2'>&ldquo;Colour, taste, and smell, smaragdus, sugar and musk,&mdash;<br />
Amber for the tongue, for the eye a picture rare,&mdash;<br />
If you cut the fruit in slices, every slice a crescent fair,&mdash;<br />
If you leave it whole, the full harvest moon is there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hafiz is the prince of Persian poets, and in his extraordinary gifts
adds to some of the attributes of Pindar, Anacreon, Horace, and Burns
the insight of a mystic, that sometimes affords a deeper glance at
Nature than belongs to either of these bards. He accosts all topics with
an easy audacity. &ldquo;He only,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;is fit for company, who knows how
to prize earthly happiness at the value of a nightcap. Our father Adam
sold Paradise for two kernels of wheat; then blame me not if I hold it
dear at one grapestone.&rdquo; He says to the Shah, &ldquo;Thou who rulest after
words and thoughts which no ear has heard and no mind has thought,
abide firm until thy young destiny tears off his blue coat from the old
graybeard of the sky.&rdquo; <span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_111' id='Page_111'>[Pg 111]</a></span> He says:&mdash;</p>

<p class='poem2'>&ldquo;I batter the wheel of heaven<br />
<span class='poemi1'>When it rolls not rightly by;</span><br />
I am not one of the snivellers,<br />
<span class='poemi1'>Who fall thereon and die.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>The rapidity of his turns is always surprising us:&mdash;</p>

<p class='poem2'>&ldquo;See how the roses burn!<br />
<span class='poemi1'>Bring wine to quench the fire!</span><br />
Alas! the flames come up with us,&mdash;<br />
<span class='poemi1'>We perish with desire.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>After the manner of his nation, he abounds in pregnant sentences which
might be engraved on a sword-blade and almost on a ring. &ldquo;In honour dies
he to whom the great seems ever wonderful.&rdquo; &ldquo;Here is the sum, that, when
one door opens, another shuts.&rdquo; &ldquo;On every side is an ambush laid by the
robber-troops of circumstance; hence it is that the horseman of life
urges on his courser at headlong speed.&rdquo; &ldquo;The earth is a host who
murders his guests.&rdquo; &ldquo;Good is what goes on the road of Nature. On the
straight way the traveller never misses.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_112' id='Page_112'>[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p class='poem2'>&ldquo;Alas! till now I had not known<br />
My guide and Fortune&rsquo;s guide are one.&rdquo;</p>

<p class='poem2'>&ldquo;The understanding&rsquo;s copper coin<br />
Counts not with the gold of love.&rdquo;</p>

<p class='poem2'>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis writ on Paradise&rsquo;s gate,<br />
&lsquo;Woe to the dupe that yields to Fate!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p class='poem2'>&ldquo;The world is a bride superbly dressed;<br />
Who weds her for dowry must pay his soul.&rdquo;</p>

<p class='poem2'>&ldquo;Loose the knots of the heart; never think on thy fate;<br />
No Euclid has yet disentangled that snarl.&rdquo;</p>

<p class='poem2'>&ldquo;There resides in the grieving<br />
<span class='poemi1'>A poison to kill;</span><br />
Beware to go near them,<br />
<span class='poemi1'>&rsquo;Tis pestilent still.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>Harems and wine-shops only give him a new ground of observation, whence
to draw sometimes a deeper moral than regulated sober life affords,&mdash;and
this is foreseen:&mdash;</p>

<p class='poem2'>&ldquo;I will be drunk and down with wine;<br />
Treasures we find in a ruined house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Riot, he thinks, can snatch from the deeply hidden lot the veil that
covers it:&mdash;</p>

<p class='poem2'>&ldquo;To be wise the dull brain so earnestly throbs,<br />
Bring bands of wine for the stupid head.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_113' id='Page_113'>[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p class='poem2'>&ldquo;The Builder of heaven<br />
<span class='poemi1'>Hath sundered the earth,</span><br />
So that no footway<br />
<span class='poemi1'>Leads out of it forth.</span></p>

<p class='poem2'>&ldquo;On turnpikes of wonder<br />
<span class='poemi1'>Wine leads the mind forth,</span><br />
Straight, sidewise, and upward,<br />
<span class='poemi1'>West, southward, and north.</span></p>

<p class='poem2'>&ldquo;Stands the vault adamantine<br />
<span class='poemi1'>Until the Doomsday;</span><br />
The wine-cup shall ferry<br />
<span class='poemi1'>Thee o&rsquo;er it away.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>That hardihood and self-equality of every sound nature, which result
from the feeling that the spirit in him is entire and as good as the
world, which entitle the poet to speak with authority, and make him an
object of interest, and his every phrase and syllable significant, are
in Hafiz, and abundantly fortify and ennoble his tone.</p>

<p>His was the fluent mind in which every thought and feeling came readily
to the lips. &ldquo;Loose the knots of the heart,&rdquo; he says. We absorb elements
enough, but have not leaves and lungs for healthy perspiration and
growth. An air of sterility, of incompetence to their proper aims,
belongs to many who have both experience and wisdom. But a large
utterance, <span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_114' id='Page_114'>[Pg 114]</a></span> a river that makes its own shores, quick perception and
corresponding expression, a constitution to which every morrow is a new
day, which is equal to the needs of life, at once tender and bold, with
great arteries,&mdash;this generosity of ebb and flow satisfies, and we
should be willing to die when our time comes, having had our swing and
gratification. The difference is not so much in the quality of men&rsquo;s
thoughts as in the power of uttering them. What is pent and smouldered
in the dumb actor is not pent in the poet, but passes over into new
form, at once relief and creation.</p>

<p>The other merit of Hafiz is his intellectual liberty, which is a
certificate of profound thought. We accept the religions and politics
into which we fall; and it is only a few delicate spirits who are
sufficient to see that the whole web of convention is the imbecility of
those whom it entangles,&mdash;that the mind suffers no religion and no
empire but its own. It indicates this respect to absolute truth by the
use it makes of the symbols that are most stable and reverend, and
therefore is always provoking the accusation of irreligion.</p>

<p>Hypocrisy is the perpetual butt of his arrows.</p>

<p class='poem2'>&ldquo;Let us draw the cowl through the brook of wine.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_115' id='Page_115'>[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>He tells his mistress that not the dervis, or the monk, but the lover,
has in his heart the spirit which makes the ascetic and the saint; and
certainly not their cowls and mummeries, but her glances, can impart to
him the fire and virtue needful for such self-denial. Wrong shall not be
wrong to Hafiz, for the name&rsquo;s sake. A law or statute is to him what a
fence is to a nimble school-boy,&mdash;a temptation for a jump. &ldquo;We would do
nothing but good, else would shame come to us on the day when the soul
must hie hence; and should they then deny us Paradise, the Houris
themselves would forsake that, and come out to us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His complete intellectual emancipation he communicates to the reader.
There is no example of such facility of allusion, such use of all
materials. Nothing is too high, nothing too low, for his occasion. He
fears nothing, he stops for nothing. Love is a leveller, and Allah
becomes a groom, and heaven a closet, in his daring hymns to his
mistress or to his cupbearer. This boundless charter is the right of
genius.</p>

<p>We do not wish to strew sugar on bottled spiders, or try to make
mystical divinity out of the Song of Solomon, much less out of the
erotic and bacchanalian songs of Hafiz. Hafiz himself is determined to
defy all such hypocritical interpretation, and tears off his turban and
throws it at the head of the meddling dervis, and throws his glass after
the turban. <span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_116' id='Page_116'>[Pg 116]</a></span> But the love or the wine of Hafiz is not to be confounded
with vulgar debauch. It is the spirit in which the song is written that
imports, and not the topics. Hafiz praises wine, roses, maidens, boys,
birds, mornings, and music, to give vent to his immense hilarity and
sympathy with every form of beauty and joy; and lays the emphasis on
these to mark his scorn of sanctimony and base prudence. These are the
natural topics and language of his wit and perception. But it is the
play of wit and the joy of song that he loves; and if you mistake him
for a low rioter, he turns short on you with verses which express the
poverty of sensual joys, and to ejaculate with equal fire the most
unpalatable affirmations of heroic sentiment and contempt for the world.
Sometimes it is a glance from the height of thought, as thus:&mdash;&ldquo;Bring
wine; for, in the audience-hall of the soul&rsquo;s independence, what is
sentinel or Sultan? what is the wise man or the intoxicated?&rdquo; And
sometimes his feast, feasters, and world are only one pebble more in the
eternal vortex and revolution of Fate:&mdash;</p>

<p class='poem2'>&ldquo;I am; what I am<br />
My dust will be again.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_117' id='Page_117'>[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>A saint might lend an ear to the riotous fun of Falstaff; for it is not
created to excite the animal appetites, but to vent the joy of a
supernal intelligence. In all poetry, Pindar&rsquo;s rule holds,&mdash;<ins class='greek' title='[Greek: synetois ph&ocirc;nei]'>&#963;&#965;&#957;&#949;&#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#966;&#969;&#957;&#949;&#8055;</ins>,
it speaks to the intelligent; and Hafiz is a poet for
poets, whether he write, as sometimes, with a parrot&rsquo;s, or, as at other
times, with an eagle&rsquo;s quill.</p>

<p>Every song of Hafiz affords new proof of the unimportance of your
subject to success, provided only the treatment be cordial. In general,
what is more tedious than dedications or panegyrics addressed to
grandees? Yet in the &ldquo;Divan&rdquo; you would not skip them, since his muse
seldom supports him better.</p>

<p class='poem2'>&ldquo;What lovelier forms things wear,<br />
Now that the Shah comes back!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And again:&mdash;</p>

<p class='poem2'>&ldquo;Thy foes to hunt, thy enviers to strike down,<br />
Poises Arcturus aloft morning and evening his spear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is told of Hafiz, that, when he had written a compliment to a
handsome youth,&mdash;</p>

<p class='poem2'>&ldquo;Take my heart in thy hand, O beautiful boy of Shiraz!<br />
I would give for the mole on thy cheek Samarcand and Buchara!&rdquo;&mdash;<br /></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_118' id='Page_118'>[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>the verses came to the ear of Timour in his palace. Timour taxed Hafiz
with treating disrespectfully his two cities, to raise and adorn which
he had conquered nations. Hafiz replied, &ldquo;Alas, my lord, if I had not
been so prodigal, I had not been so poor!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Persians had a mode of establishing copyright the most secure of any
contrivance with which we are acquainted. The law of the <i>ghaselle</i>, or
shorter ode, requires that the poet insert his name in the last stanza.
Almost every one of several hundreds of poems of Hafiz contains his name
thus interwoven more or less closely with the subject of the piece. It
is itself a test of skill, as this self-naming is not quite easy. We
remember but two or three examples in English poetry; that of Chaucer,
in the &ldquo;House of Fame&rdquo;: Jonson&rsquo;s epitaph on his son,&mdash;</p>

<p class='poem2'>&ldquo;Ben Jonson his best piece of poetry&rdquo;:</p>

<p>and Cowley&rsquo;s,&mdash;</p>

<p class='poem2'>&ldquo;The melancholy Cowley lay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But it is easy to Hafiz. It gives him the opportunity of the most
playful self-assertion, always gracefully, sometimes almost in the fun
of Falstaff, sometimes with feminine delicacy. He tells us, &ldquo;The angels
in heaven were lately learning his last pieces.&rdquo; He says, <span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_119' id='Page_119'>[Pg 119]</a></span> &ldquo;The fishes
shed their pearls, out of desire and longing as soon as the ship of
Hafiz swims the deep.&rdquo;</p>

<p class='poem2'>&ldquo;Out of the East, out of the West, no man understands me;<br />
O, the happier I, who confide to none but the wind!<br />
This morning heard I how the lyre of the stars resounded,<br />
&lsquo;Sweeter tones have we heard from Hafiz!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again,&mdash;&ldquo;I heard the harp of the planet Venus, and it said in the early
morning, &lsquo;I am the disciple of the sweet-voiced Hafiz!&rsquo;&rdquo; And
again,&mdash;&ldquo;When Hafiz sings, the angels hearken, and Anaitis, the leader
of the starry host, calls even the Messiah in heaven out to the dance.&rdquo;
&ldquo;No one has unveiled thoughts like Hafiz, since the locks of the
Word-bride were first curled.&rdquo; &ldquo;Only he despises the verse of Hafiz who
is not himself by nature noble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But we must try to give some of these poetic flourishes the metrical
form which they seem to require:&mdash;</p>

<p class='poem2'>&ldquo;Fit for the Pleiad&rsquo;s azure chord<br />
The songs I sung, the pearls I bored.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another:&mdash;</p>

<p class='poem2'>&ldquo;I have no hoarded treasure,<br />
<span class='poemi1'>Yet have I rich content;</span><br />
The first from Allah to the Shah,<br />
<span class='poemi1'>The last to Hafiz went.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_120' id='Page_120'>[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>Another:&mdash;</p>

<p class='poem2'>&ldquo;High heart, O Hafiz! though not thine<br />
<span class='poemi1'>Fine gold and silver ore;</span><br />
More worth to thee the gift of song,<br />
<span class='poemi1'>And the clear insight more.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>Again:&mdash;</p>

<p class='poem2'>&ldquo;O Hafiz speak not of thy need;<br />
<span class='poemi1'>Are not these verses thine?</span><br />
Then all the poets are agreed,<br />
<span class='poemi1'>No man can less repine.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>He asserts his dignity as bard and inspired man of his people. To the
Vizier returning from Mecca, he says, &ldquo;Boast not rashly, prince of
pilgrims, of thy fortune. Thou hast indeed seen the temple; but I, the
Lord of the temple. Nor has any man inhaled from the musk-bladder of the
merchant, or from the musky morning-wind, that sweet air which I am
permitted to breathe every hour of the day.&rdquo; And with still more vigour
in the following lines:&mdash;</p>

<p class='poem2'>&ldquo;Oft have I said, I say it once more,<br />
I, a wanderer, do not stray from myself,<br />
I am a kind of parrot; the mirror is holden to me;<br />
What the Eternal says, I stammering say again.<br />
Give me what you will; I eat thistles as roses,<br />
And according to my food I grow and I give.<br />
Scorn me not, but know I have the pearl,<br />
And am only seeking one to receive it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_121' id='Page_121'>[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>And his claim has been admitted from the first. The muleteers and
camel-drivers, on their way through the desert, sing snatches of his
songs, not so much for the thought, as for their joyful temper and tone;
and the cultivated Persians know his poems by heart. Yet Hafiz does not
appear to have set any great value on his songs, since his scholars
collected them for the first time after his death.</p>

<p>In the following poem the soul is figured as the Ph&#339;nix alighting on
Tuba, the Tree of Life:&mdash;</p>

<p class='poem2'>&ldquo;My ph&#339;nix long ago secured<br />
<span class='poemi1'>His nest in the sky-vault&rsquo;s cope;</span><br />
In the body&rsquo;s cage immured,<br />
<span class='poemi1'>He was weary of life&rsquo;s hope.</span></p>

<p class='poem2'>&ldquo;Round and round this heap of ashes<br />
<span class='poemi1'>Now flies the bird amain,</span><br />
But in that odorous niche of heaven<br />
<span class='poemi1'>Nestles the bird again.</span></p>

<p class='poem2'>&ldquo;Once, flies he upwards, he will perch<br />
<span class='poemi1'>On Tuba&rsquo;s golden bough;</span><br />
His home is on that fruited arch<br />
<span class='poemi1'>Which cools the blest below.</span></p>

<p class='poem2'>&ldquo;If over this world of ours<br />
<span class='poemi1'>His wings my ph&#339;nix spread,</span><br />
How gracious falls on land and sea<br />
<span class='poemi1'>The soul-refreshing shade!</span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_122' id='Page_122'>[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p class='poem2'>&ldquo;Either world inhabits he,<br />
<span class='poemi1'>See oft below him planets roll;</span><br />
His body is all of air compact,<br />
<span class='poemi1'>Of Allah&rsquo;s love his soul.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>Here is an ode which is said to be a favourite with all educated
Persians:&mdash;</p>

<p class='poem2'>&ldquo;Come!&mdash;the palace of heaven rest on a&euml;ry pillars,&mdash;<br />
Come, and bring me wine; our days are wind.<br />
I declare myself the slave of that masculine soul<br />
Which ties and alliance on earth once for ever renounces.<br />
Told I thee yester-morn how the Iris of heaven<br />
Brought to me in my cup a gospel of joy?<br />
O high-flying falcon! the Tree of Life is thy perch;<br />
This nook of grief fits thee ill for a nest.<br />
Hearken! they call to thee down from the ramparts of heaven;<br />
I cannot divine what holds thee here in a net.<br />
I, too, have a counsel for thee; O mark it and keep it.<br />
Since I received the same from the Master above:<br />
Seek not for faith or for truth in a world of light-minded girls;<br />
A thousand suitors reckons this dangerous bride.<br />
Cumber thee not for the world, and this my precept forget not,<br />
&rsquo;Tis but a toy that a vagabond sweetheart has left us.<br />
Accept whatever befalls; uncover thy brow from thy locks;<br /><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_123' id='Page_123'>[Pg 123]</a></span>
Never to me nor to thee was option imparted;<br />
Neither endurance nor truth belongs to the laugh of the rose.<br />
The loving nightingale mourns;&mdash;cause enow for mourning;&mdash;<br />
Why envies the bird the streaming verses of Hafiz?<br />
Know that a god bestowed on him eloquent speech.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The cedar, the cypress, the palm, the olive, and fig-tree, the birds
that inhabit them, and the garden flowers, are never wanting in these
musky verses, and are always named with effect. &ldquo;The willows,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;bow themselves to every wind, out of shame for their unfruitfulness.&rdquo;
We may open anywhere on a floral catalogue.</p>

<p class='poem2'>&ldquo;By breath of beds of roses drawn,<br />
<span class='poemi1'>I found the grove in the morning pure,</span><br />
In the concert of the nightingales<br />
<span class='poemi1'>My drunken brain to cure.</span></p>

<p class='poem2'>&ldquo;With unrelated glance<br />
<span class='poemi1'>I looked the rose in the eye:</span><br />
The rose in the hour of gloaming<br />
<span class='poemi1'>Flamed like a lamp hard-by.</span></p>

<p class='poem2'>&ldquo;She was of her beauty proud.<br />
<span class='poemi1'>And prouder of her youth,</span><br />
The while unto her flaming heart<br />
<span class='poemi1'>The bulbul gave his truth.</span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_124' id='Page_124'>[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p class='poem2'>&ldquo;The sweet narcissus closed<br />
<span class='poemi1'>Its eye, with passion pressed;</span><br />
The tulips out of envy burned<br />
<span class='poemi1'>Moles in their scarlet breast,</span></p>

<p class='poem2'>&ldquo;The lilies white prolonged<br />
<span class='poemi1'>Their sworded tongue to the smell;</span><br />
The clustering anemones<br />
<span class='poemi1'>Their pretty secrets tell.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>Presently we have,&mdash;</p>

<p class='poem2'><span class='poemi2'>&ldquo;All day the rain</span><br />
Bathed the dark hyacinths in vain,<br />
The flood may pour from morn till night<br />
Nor wash the pretty Indians white.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so onward, through many a page.</p>

<p>This picture of the first days of Spring, from Enweri, seems to belong
to Hafiz:&mdash;</p>

<p class='poem2'>&ldquo;O&rsquo;er the garden water goes the wind alone<br />
<span class='poemi1'>To rasp and to polish the cheek of the wave;</span><br />
The fire is quenched on the dear hearthstone,<br />
<span class='poemi1'>But it burns again on the tulips brave.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>Friendship is a favourite topic of the Eastern poets, and they have
matched on this head the absoluteness of Montaigne.</p>

<p>Hafiz says, &ldquo;Thou learnest no secret until thou knoweth friendship;
since to the unsound no heavenly knowledge enters.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_125' id='Page_125'>[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>Ibn Jemin writes thus:</p>

<p class='poem2'>&ldquo;Whilst I disdain the populace,<br />
I find no peer in higher place,<br />
Friend is a word of royal tone,<br />
Friend is a poem all alone.</p>

<p class='poem2'>&ldquo;Wisdom is like the elephant,<br />
Lofty and rare inhabitant:<br />
He dwells in deserts or in courts;<br />
With hucksters he has no resorts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dschami says,&mdash;</p>

<p class='poem2'>&ldquo;A friend is he, who, hunted as a foe,<br />
<span class='poemi1'>So much the kindlier shows him than before;</span><br />
Throw stones at him, or ruder javelins throw,<br />
<span class='poemi1'>He builds with stone and steel a firmer floor.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>Of the amatory poetry of Hafiz we must be very sparing in our citations,
though it forms the staple of the &ldquo;Divan.&rdquo; He has run through the whole
gamut of passion,&mdash;from the sacred to the borders, and over the borders,
of the profane. The same confusion of high and low, the celerity of
flight and allusion which our colder muses forbid, is habitual to him.
From the plain text,&mdash;</p>

<p class='poem2'>&ldquo;The chemist of love<br />
<span class='poemi1'>Will this perishing mould,</span><br />
Were it made out of mire,<br />
<span class='poemi1'>Transmute into gold.&rdquo;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>he proceeds to the celebration of his passion; and nothing in his
religious or in his scientific traditions is too sacred or too remote
to afford a token of his mistress. <span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_126' id='Page_126'>[Pg 126]</a></span> The Moon thought she knew her own
orbit well enough; but when she saw the curve on Zuleika&rsquo;s cheek, she
was at a loss:&mdash;</p>

<p class='poem2'>&ldquo;And since round lines are drawn<br />
<span class='poemi1'>My darling&rsquo;s lips about,</span><br />
The very Moon looks puzzled on,<br />
<span class='poemi1'>And hesitates in doubt</span><br />
If the sweet curve that rounds thy mouth<br />
<span class='poemi1'>Be not her true way to the South.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>His ingenuity never sleeps:&mdash;</p>

<p class='poem2'>&ldquo;Ah could I hide me in my song,<br />
To kiss thy lips from which it flows!&rdquo;</p>

<p>and plays in a thousand pretty courtesies:&mdash;</p>

<p class='poem2'>&ldquo;Fair fall thy soft heart!<br />
<span class='poemi1'>A good work wilt thou do?</span><br />
O, pray for the dead<br />
<span class='poemi1'>Whom thine eyelashes slew;&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>And what a nest has he found for his bonny bird to take up her abode
in!&mdash;</p>

<p class='poem2'>&ldquo;They strew in the paths of kings and czars<br />
<span class='poemi1'>Jewels and gems of price:</span><br />
But for thy head I will pluck down stars,<br />
<span class='poemi1'>And pave thy way with eyes.</span></p>

<p class='poem2'>&ldquo;I have sought for thee a costlier dome<br />
<span class='poemi1'>Than Mahmoud&rsquo;s palace high,</span><br />
And thou, returning, find thy home<br />
<span class='poemi1'>In the apple of Love&rsquo;s eye.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_127' id='Page_127'>[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>Then we have all degrees of passionate abandonment:&mdash;</p>

<p class='poem2'>&ldquo;I know this perilous love-lane<br />
<span class='poemi1'>No whither the traveller leads,</span><br />
Yet my fancy the sweet scent of<br />
<span class='poemi1'>Thy tangled tresses feeds.</span></p>

<p class='poem2'>&ldquo;In the midnight of thy locks,<br />
<span class='poemi1'>I renounce the day;</span><br />
In the ring of thy rose-lips,<br />
<span class='poemi1'>My heart forgets to pray.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>And sometimes his love rises to a religious sentiment:&mdash;</p>

<p class='poem2'>&ldquo;Plunge in your angry waves,<br />
<span class='poemi1'>Renouncing doubt and care;</span><br />
The flowing of the seven broad seas<br />
<span class='poemi1'>Shall never wet thy hair.</span></p>

<p class='poem2'>&ldquo;Is Allah&rsquo;s face on thee<br />
<span class='poemi1'>Bending with love benign,</span><br />
And thou not less on Allah&rsquo;s eye,<br />
<span class='poemi1'>O fairest turnest thine.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>We add to these fragments of Hafiz a few specimens from other poets.</p>

<h3 class='indent'>NISAMI.</h3>

<p class='poem2'>&ldquo;While roses bloomed along the plain,<br />
The nightingale to the falcon said,<br />
&lsquo;Why of all birds must thou be dumb?<br />
With closed mouth thou utterest,<br />
Though dying, no last word to man.<br /><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_128' id='Page_128'>[Pg 128]</a></span>
Yet sitt&rsquo;st thou on the hand of princes,<br />
And feedest on the grouse&rsquo;s breast,<br />
Whilst I, who hundred thousand jewels<br />
Squander in a single tone,<br />
Lo! I feed myself with worms,<br />
And my dwelling is the thorn.&rsquo;&mdash;<br />
The falcon answered, &lsquo;Be all ear:<br />
I, experienced in affairs,<br />
See fifty things, say never one;<br />
But thee the people prizes not<br />
Who, doing nothing, say&rsquo;st a thousand.<br />
To me, appointed to the chase,<br />
The king&rsquo;s hand gives the grouse&rsquo;s breast;<br />
Whilst a chatterer like thee<br />
Must gnaw worms in the thorn. Farewell!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The following passages exhibit the strong tendency of the Persian poets
to contemplative and religious poetry and to allegory.</p>

<h3 class='indent'>ENWERI.<br />

<p>Ferideddin Attar wrote the &ldquo;Bird Conversations,&rdquo; a mystical tale in
which the birds coming together to choose their king, resolve on a
pilgrimage to Mount Kaf, to pay their homage to the Simorg. From this
poem, written five hundred years ago, we cite the following passage, as
a proof of the identity of mysticism in all periods. The tone is quite
modern. In the fable, the birds were soon weary of the length and
difficulties of the way, and at last almost all gave out. <span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_130' id='Page_130'>[Pg 130]</a></span> Three only
persevered, and arrived before the throne of the Simorg.</p>

<p class='poem2'>&ldquo;The bird-soul was ashamed;<br />
Their body was quite annihilated;<br />
They had cleaned themselves from the dust,<br />
And were by the light ensouled.<br />
What was, and was not,&mdash;the Past,&mdash;<br />
Was wiped out from their breast.<br />
The sun from near-by beamed<br />
Clearest light into their soul;<br />
The resplendence of the Simorg beamed<br />
As one back from all three.<br />
They knew not, amazed, if they<br />
Were either this or that.<br />
They saw themselves all as Simorg,<br />
Themselves in the eternal Simorg.<br />
When to the Simorg up they looked,<br />
They beheld him among themselves;<br />
And when they looked on each other<br />
They saw themselves in the Simorg.<br />
A single look grouped the two parties,<br />
The Simorg emerged, the Simorg vanished,<br />
This in that, and that in this,<br />
As the world has never heard.<br />
So remained they, sunk in wonder,<br />
Thoughtless in deepest thinking,<br />
And quite unconscious of themselves.<br /><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_131' id='Page_131'>[Pg 131]</a></span>
Speechless prayed they to the Highest<br />
To open this secret,<br />
And to unlock <i>Thou</i> and <i>We</i>.<br />
There came an answer without tongue.&mdash;<br />
&lsquo;The Highest is a sun-mirror;<br />
Who comes to Him sees himself therein,<br />
Sees body and soul, and soul and body;<br />
When you came to the Simorg,<br />
Three therein appeared to you,<br />
And, had fifty of you come,<br />
So had you seen yourselves as many.<br />
Him has none of us yet seen.<br />
Ants see not the Pleiades.<br />
Can the gnat grasp with his teeth<br />
The body of the elephant?<br />
What you see is He not;<br />
What you hear is He not.<br />
The valleys which you traverse,<br />
The actions which you perform,<br />
They lie under our treatment<br />
And among our properties<br />
You as three birds are amazed,<br />
Impatient, heartless, confused:<br />
Far over you am I raised,<br />
Since I am in act Simorg.<br />
Ye blot out my highest being,<br />
That ye may find yourselves on my throne;<br />
For ever ye blot out yourselves,<br />
As shadows in the sun. Farewell!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
